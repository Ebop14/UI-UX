This is some of my UI/UX work in Figma! These iterations are the steps I took on my way to creating a productivity optimization app for college students. 

Along with the grayscale iteration / final product, I've also included a summary of some customer interviews, what we were solving for, our design process, feature overview, etc. 

All of the links here are hosted on Figma.
